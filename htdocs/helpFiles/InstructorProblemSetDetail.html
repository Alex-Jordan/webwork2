<h2>Set Detail Help</h2>

<h3>Editing Modes</h3>
<p>The <strong>Set Detail</strong> page can be viewed in one of two distinct modes:
<ul>
	<li>Editing for all students</li>
	<li>Editing for one student or a proper subset of all students</li>
</ul>
</p>

The current mode should be made clear by the information at the top of the page.

<h3>Page Contents</h3>
<ul>
	<li>General Information</li>
	<li>Headers</li>
	<li>Problems</li>
</ul>

<h3>Form Elements Present on the Page</h3>
<dl>
	<dt>Save Changes</dt>
	<dd>
		This button is present both at top and the bottom of the page. Any and all changes made to any part of the set
		will be saved with one important exception: When editing the set for one or more students, you can choose to
		override the default value (defined for the set in general) by clicking on the checkbox and providing a value
		(or possibly leaving blank) and checking the override checkbox. If you do <strong>NOT</strong> check the
		checkbox, the override value will be discarded and the default value for the set will be used for the users
		currently being edited.
	</dd>

	<dt>Reset Form</dt>
	<dd>
		This button is also present both at top and the bottom of the page. Discards all changes, reloading the page by
		re-reading the database information for this set.
	</dd>

	<dt>Renumber Problems</dt>
	<dd>
		Renumber problems consecutively starting from 1. This renumbering is not saved until "Save Changes" is clicked.
	</dd>

	<dt>Render All</dt>
	<dd>Render all problems on the page. This does not reload the page or save or reset changes.</dd>

	<dt>Hide All</dt>
	<dd>Hide all rendered problems on the page.</dd>

	<dt>Expand All Details</dt>
	<dd>
		Expand problem details that have been collapsed. Note that the details of a single problem can be expanded by
		clicking on the down arrow to the right of the problem source file.
	</dd>

	<dt>Collapse All Details</dt>
	<dd>
		Collapse problem details to the top row of information about a problem. Note that the details of a single
		problem can be collapsed by clicking on the up arrow to the right of the problem source file.
	</dd>

	<dt>Expand All Nesting</dt>
	<dd>
		Only present for JITAR sets. Expand JITAR nested problem groups that have been collapsed. Note that the
		nesting of a single problem group can be expanded by clicking on the right arrow to the right of the problem
		number.
	</dd>

	<dt>Collapse All Nesting</dt>
	<dd>
		Only present for JITAR sets. Collapse JITAR nesting problem groups to the top row of information about a
		problem. Note that the nesting of a single problem group can be collapsed by clicking on the down arrow to the
		right of the problem number.
	</dd>

	<dt>Display Mode</dt>
	<dd>Select the display mode used to render the problems on this page.</dd>

	<dt>Automatically render problems on page load.</dt>
	<dd>Automatically render all problems in the set on this page when "Save Changes" or "Reset Form" is clicked.</dd>

	<dt>Force problems to be numbered consecutively from one</dt>
	<dd>
		Renumber problems in the set consecutively starting from one. In the process of deleting problems, the numbering
		can be made non-consecutive. This is useful to clean up the problem numbering.
	</dd>

	<dt>Add n blank problem template(s) to the end of homework set.</dt>
	<dd>
		Adds new, essentially blank, problems to the set when the set is saved. You can modify this problem to create
		your own problem, by clicking on the "Edit Problem" link and saving the "blankProblem.pg" to some new file, e.g.
		"myNewProblem.pg".
	</dd>
</dl>

<h3>General Page Information</h3>
<dl>
	<dt>Reordering Problems</dt>
	<dd>
		You can reorder problems by clicking on the arrow icon and dragging the problem. You will see a box showing you
		where the problem will be placed. When problems are reordered any holes in the numbering will be filled in.
	</dd>

	<dt>Deleting Problems</dt>
	<dd>
		You can delete problems by clicking the "Delete it?" check box and saving. If the set is already active it is
		recommended that you instead use the "Mark Correct?" problem to mark a particular problem correct for all
		students.
	</dd>

	<dt>Rendering Problems</dt>
	<dd>
		You can render a problem by clicking the "Render Problem" icon to the right of the problem number. The display
		mode used to render the problem is chosen using the drop down menu. You can render all problems using the
		"Render All" button. "Hide All" will hide all rendered problems. It is also useful to collapse problem details
		when doing this, as it makes it easier to drag problems around.
	</dd>

	<dt>Editing Problems</dt>
	<dd>
		You can edit a problem by clicking the "Edit Problem" icon to the right of the problem number. This will open
		the problem in the PG problem editor in a new tab or window.
	</dd>

	<dt>Viewing Problems in a New Window</dt>
	<dd>
		If you click on the "Open in New Window" icon to the right of the problem number, then the problem will open in
		the actual homework set in a new tab or window.
	</dd>

	<dt>Grading Problems</dt>
	<dd>
		If you click on the "Grade Problem" icon to the right of the problem number, then the problem will open in the
		manual problem grader. This page shows the rendered problem and lists all students assigned to the set and the
		last answer the students entered for the problem. You can then change the recorded scores for students on this
		problem and provide instructor feedback comments.
	</dd>

	<dt>Problem Paths</dt>
	<dd>
		All of the paths for problem files are relative to the templates directory of the current course. You can access
		this directory "directly" using the File Manager page.
	</dd>
