<h2>Statistics Help</h2>
<p>
	This page is a useful tool for instructors who want to see how their students are doing. Statistics can either be
	viewed for a single set or for a single user simply by clicking on the link.
</p>
<p class="mb-0">
	The "Success Index" column is:
	(totalNumberOfCorrectProblems / totalNumberOfProblems)^2/ AvgNumberOfAttemptsPerProblem),
	which is a useful measure for summarizing how well students are doing.
