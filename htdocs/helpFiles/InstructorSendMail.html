<h2>Email Help</h2>
<p>
	Emails can be sent from this page to the class. Be sure to change all blanks which read "fixme". The email can be
	sent to all students, or some subset. To change the way the students are ordered, after selecting the criteria, push
	the "Change Display Settings" button.
</p>
<p>
	Personalized data can be inserted into the message using any of the variables available in the drop down menu titled
	"list of insertable macros". Most of the personal data does not need a merge file, but if you wish to include
	scoring data, you must select that scoring file as the merge file, and then enter the score into the message by
	using what ever column the score is in. For example, if the scores where in the 4 column of s0scr.cvs then I would
	set the merge file to that file, and then type $COL[4] to have that be the score.

	The size of the email box can be changed by changing the numbers in the "columns" and "rows" boxes and pressing
	enter.
