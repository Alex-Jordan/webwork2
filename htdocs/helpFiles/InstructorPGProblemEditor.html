<h1>PG Problem Editor Help Page</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>
	This page allows one to edit the contents of PG problem files (templates) as well as set headers and other files.
</p>
<p>
	When using this page two or more windows may be created -- one to edit the text in the file and one to view the
	results. This can be a bit confusing. If a window seems to have completely disappeared make sure that it is not
	hiding behind one of the other windows.

		<dd>
			This links to an (incomplete) list of the most commonly used macros with a description of their parameters
			and how to use them.
		</dd>
		<dt><a href="http://devel.webwork.rochester.edu/twiki/bin/view/Webwork/PGmacrosByFile">macro list</a></dt>
		<dd>This link provides a complete list of macros.</dd>
		<dt><a href="http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Category:Authors">authoring info and help</a> </dt>
		<dd>This link takes you to the authoring section of the WeBWorK wiki.</dd>
		<dt><a href="http://devel.webwork.rochester.edu/doc/cvs/pg_HEAD/">testing lab</a></dt>
		<dd>This links to a WeBWorK "problem" which allows you to try out fragments of PG code.</dd>
		<dt><a href="http://devel.webwork.rochester.edu/doc/cvs/pg_HEAD/">pod docs</a></dt>
		<dd>
			This link gives details for many macros. It links to documentation embedded in the macro files themselves.

		<dd>
			If you find an error in a library problem please use the link to notify us so that we can fix it. You will
			need to register with an email address the first time you use bugzilla, but after that you will not.

	</dd>
	<dt>The large text window</dt>
	<dd>
		This is where you edit the text of the problem template. Nothing happens until you pick an action (below) and
		click the "Take action!" button.
	</dd>
	<dt>Text Editor Options</dt>
	<dd>
	<dl>
		<dt>Theme</dt>
		<dd>Select your favorite theme for the large text window.</dd>
		<dt>Key Map</dt>
		<dd>
            The key maps that are available are "default", "emacs", "sublime", and "vim". The "default" key map has the
            standard behavior of a browser text area. You can use Ctrl-C to copy, Ctrl-V to paste, Ctrl-F to search,
            etc. If you are more comfortable with the "emacs", "sublime", or "vim" text editors then you may choose to
            use one of those key maps instead.
		</dd>
		<dt>Enable Spell Checking</dt>
		<dd>
            Spell check the text of the file that your are editing. Note that there will be many spelling errors in the
            code parts of your file.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Action items:</h2> <i>(If an action cannot be executed it will not appear as an action item.)
</i>
<dl>
	<dt>View using seed "12345" and display mode "image"</dt>
	<dd>
		Will bring up a window to show the results of your editing. It does not change the permanent file on the disk.
		You can view different versions of the same problem by changing the seed (any number will do). You can also
		change the manner in which the mathematics is typeset.
	</dd>
	<dt>Add to set ...</dt>
	<dd>
		Add this problem as the last problem of an existing set, either as a problem or as the set header (the text that
		appears on the home page of a homework set). You can rearrange the order of the problems later using the "Hmwk
		Sets Editor"
	</dd>
	<dt>Save as [TMPL]/"path"...</dt>
	<dd>
		Makes a new copy of the file you are editing at the location relative to the course's templates ([TMPL])
		directory given by "path". The checkbox allows you to replace the current problem with the new problem in the
		current homework set.
		<p>Check the checkbox if you want to edit the current problem without changing the original problem file.</p>
		<p>
			Leave the checkbox unchecked if you are using the current problem as a model for a brand new problem. You
			can add the new file to the homework set from the Library Browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the original problem can not be edited than the path name must be changed in order to be allowed to save
			the problem. Adding "local/" to the beginning of the original path is the default solution. All locally
			created and edited files will then appear in a subdirectory named "local".
		</p>
		<p>
			A new problem whose path ends in blankProblem.pg should be given a new name, for example, "myNewProblem.pg".
		</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Revert</dt>
	<dd>
		Reverts to the copy of the file saved on the disk -- all unsaved editing changes will be lost. This option only
		appears when you have making provisional edits using the first option "View..." above
	</dd>
	<dt>Take action</dt>
	<dd>
		Executes the action item selected above. You can elect to have the results of this action appear in a new
		window.
	</dd>
